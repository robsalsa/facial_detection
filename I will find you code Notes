First things First:
    The stuff that I used was: Visual Studio Code, Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, a webcam, and Windows Laptop

So the point of this code: 
    As the names imply this code's point is to find a face. Nothing else and nothing more. sadly I do not know how to make it look for someone in specific but this is what I was able to do. 

    For the python code named "I_Will_Find_You.py" it is the program that will look for a huminoid face while you have a webcam on or available to use in the code. While the python code named "I_Will_Find_You_Too.py" will do the same but for Static Pictures saved in your computer. 

    Unfortunatly I do not know how to make it find something specifically yet this is what I was able to do using Python (a language that I am still learning).

The most important part of these Python programs is the imported libaries that can be called through Windows using:
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install mediapipe
In the terminal function in Visual Studio Code.


For the "I Will Find You Too": 
    Since I was using a Windows OS the method to look for a picture inside a file or just inside your computer this is how it should look: 
        "C:\Users\robsalsa\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\findme.jpg"

        NOTE: The name can be very different from what you have so knowing that you can copy & paste the Windows path for this stuff will help a lot. SO NAME STUFF SO IT IS EASY TO FIND
